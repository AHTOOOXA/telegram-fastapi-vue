# MedSync WebApp Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the MedSync WebApp documentation. This app serves as an efficient bridge between patients and healthcare
professionals, providing streamlined access to medical services via the Telegram platform.

This MedSync WebApp is a conceptual example application and not an actual service. All images and text content presented
are generated using AI and do not represent real entities or services.

**Key Features:**

- Swift booking of appointments with medical specialists or diagnostics tests like MRI.
- An intuitive interface to search, select, and interact with healthcare experts, diagnostic types, and clinics
- Integration with Telegram for seamless user experience.

## Showcase

For a quick start:

1. Initiate the [MedSync bot on Telegram](https://t.me/MedSyncbot).
2. Follow the prompts to navigate through the available services.

## System Requirements and Setup

Before getting started with the MedSync WebApp, ensure you have the appropriate system setup:

### Software and OS:

- **Docker & Docker-Compose**: Required to containerize and orchestrate the application services. Compatible with
  Windows, MacOS, and Linux. For MacOS and Windows users, it's recommended to have Docker Desktop installed.

### Hosting and Domain:

- **Server with Domain Ownership**: If you're deploying this project live, you'll need a server and an owned domain. For
  securing your domain, an SSL certificate is mandatory. You can obtain one, for instance, using Let's Encrypt's
  Certbot.

### Local Testing:

- **Ngrok**: If you opt to run the project locally and still want external access, you can use Ngrok. This will require
  creating an account with Ngrok, setting up a static domain (free tier), and noting down the domain for later use.
  Detailed instructions for Ngrok setup can be found on a dedicated page.

### Project Composition:

Once the Docker processes are initiated, it will orchestrate the entire project setup:

- **Frontend**: A React JS application.
- **Backend**: Comprises multiple components:
    - **Bot**: Built on the Aiogram framework.
    - **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage.
    - **Caching**: Redis is utilized for caching purposes within the bot.
    - **API**: Developed using FastAPI with SQLAlchemy for ORM, and Alembic for database migrations.
- **Documentation Image (Optional)**: While there's an image dedicated for documentation, it is commented out by default
  in the Docker configuration.
- **Ngrok (Optional)**: There's also an Ngrok configuration, but it's commented out by default.

## Project Setup

### Configuration

Setting up the MedSync Bot requires configuring certain environment variables and adjusting specific settings to match
your intended deployment environment. Properly setting these configurations ensures seamless integration and
functionality of the bot.

**[Configuration Guidelines](configuration.md)**: This section provides a detailed walkthrough on how to adjust the
essential configurations for the MedSync Bot. Ensure you've set these up before deploying.

Once you've followed through with the configuration steps, you can then move forward with the deployment process.

### Initializing Dependencies

Before diving into the core setup, it's pivotal to ensure all dependencies and related tools are in place and configured
correctly. Initializing dependencies is a foundational step that preempts the rest of the setup process, ensuring that
everything is in place for the MedSync WebApp to function correctly.

**[Dependency Initialization Guidelines](dependencies-initialization.md)**: This guide details the steps to ensure all
software, libraries, and tools are correctly installed and initialized. Adhering to these guidelines will aid in
preventing potential issues during the setup and running of the MedSync WebApp.

It's advisable to review and complete the dependency initialization before proceeding further into the setup.

# Database Service: PostgreSQL with Docker

!!! abstract "Overview"
    MedSync's data infrastructure is based on PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source object-relational database system. 

    By leveraging Docker, we can effortlessly initiate the PostgreSQL service, automatically setting up the initial database, roles, and passwords using environment variables.

## Why SQLAlchemy and Alembic?

- **SQLAlchemy**: This is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Python. It allows you to work with databases using Python objects, abstracting away much of the SQL, making database interactions more intuitive and less error-prone.

- **Alembic**: Alembic, designed to work with SQLAlchemy, manages database migrations. As your application grows and changes, so too will your database schema. Alembic helps manage these changes, ensuring data integrity.

## Database Diagram: Tables and Relations

### User, Bookings, and Diagnostic Results

```mermaid
erDiagram
    bookings ||..|o diagnostic_results : produces
    users ||..|o bookings : makes
    users ||..|o diagnostic_results : receives
```

In this design:

- A user can make multiple bookings (either with doctors or diagnostics).
- Each booking can produce multiple diagnostic results.
- A user can directly receive multiple diagnostic results.

---

### Doctors, Ratings, and Locations

```mermaid
erDiagram
    doctors ||..|o doctor_ratings : receives
    doctors ||..|| specialties : belongs_to
    doctors ||..|| locations : works_at
    doctors ||..|o bookings : receives
```

Key points:

- Doctors receive ratings from users.
- Every doctor belongs to a specific specialty.
- Doctors work at particular locations.
- Doctors can receive multiple bookings.

---

### Locations, Diagnostic Locations, and Working Hours

```mermaid
erDiagram
    locations ||..|| diagnostic_locations : has
    locations ||..|| workinghours : has
    locations ||..|o bookings : at
```

From the design:

- Locations (clinics) can have multiple diagnostic locations.
- Each location also has designated working hours.
- Bookings can be made at different locations.

---

### Diagnostics and Their Locations

```mermaid
erDiagram
    diagnostics ||..|| diagnostic_locations : has
    diagnostics ||..|o bookings : involves
```

Main points:

- Specific diagnostics are available at certain locations, represented by diagnostic locations.
- Diagnostics can be involved in multiple bookings.


## Deep Dive: Doctors Table

The `Doctors` table, as represented in the SQLAlchemy model:

```python
from typing import Optional
from sqlalchemy import Integer, String, ForeignKey, DECIMAL, TEXT
from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped, mapped_column
from .base import Base, TableNameMixin, TimestampMixin, int_pk

class Doctor(Base, TableNameMixin):
    doctor_id: Mapped[int_pk]
    location_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("locations.location_id"))
    full_name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(128))
    specialty_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("specialties.specialty_id"))
    price: Mapped[float] = mapped_column(DECIMAL(10, 2))
    photo_url: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(256))
    experience: Mapped[Optional[str]] = mapped_column(TEXT)
    certificates: Mapped[Optional[str]] = mapped_column(TEXT)
    services: Mapped[Optional[str]] = mapped_column(TEXT)
```

- Here, the `Doctor` class represents the `doctors` table in the database.
  
- Each attribute in the class corresponds to a column in the table. The type and constraints of these columns are defined using SQLAlchemy's API.

## Working with the Data: Requests Repository

The `DoctorRepo` class showcases how the data stored in the `doctors` table can be accessed and manipulated using SQLAlchemy's ORM capabilities:

```python
import datetime
from dateutil.parser import parse
from sqlalchemy import select, insert, func
from infrastructure.database.models import (
    Doctor,
    Booking,
    DoctorRating,
    Location,
)
from infrastructure.database.models.doctors import Specialty
from infrastructure.database.repo.base import BaseRepo

class DoctorRepo(BaseRepo):
    async def get_all_doctors(self) -> list[Doctor]:
        stmt = (
            select(
                ...
            )
        )
        result = await self.session.execute(stmt)
        return result.mappings().all()

    async def get_specialties(self) -> list[Specialty]:
        stmt = (
            select(Specialty)
            ...
        )
        result = await self.session.execute(stmt)
        return result.mappings().all()
```

- `DoctorRepo` contains methods that fetch all doctors and their specialties.
  
- These methods utilize the `select` function from SQLAlchemy to create a SQL SELECT statement.

# Initializing Dependencies

This section guides you through the setup and initialization of the primary dependencies required to get the MedSync
WebApp up and running. These include Docker, Docker-Compose, and the database setup.

---

## 1. Docker & Docker-Compose Setup

Docker provides an efficient way to containerize applications and their dependencies. Docker-Compose, on the other hand,
allows for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 

!!! tip
    We are using Docker and Docker-Compose to run all the services required for the MedSync WebApp. 

    Refer to [this section](https://docs.medsync.botfather.dev/#project-composition) for more details on the project composition.

### Windows

1. **Install Docker Desktop for Windows**

    - Download the [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
      from the official Docker website.
    - Launch the installer and follow the installation wizard.

2. **Docker-Compose**

    - Docker Desktop for Windows already comes bundled with Docker-Compose, so there's no need for a
      separate installation.

3. **Verify Installation**

    - Open the command prompt and run:
      ```
      docker --version
      docker-compose --version
      ```
    - Ensure that both commands return their respective versions, indicating a successful installation.
    ```bash
    Docker version 24.0.2, build cb74dfc
    Docker Compose version v2.19.1
    ```

# Ngrok Signup and Domain Acquisition

This section guides you through the process of signing up on Ngrok and acquiring domains for your project.

## Ngrok Signup

!!! question "Why Ngrok?"
    Ngrok is a versatile tool that creates secure tunnels to localhost, allowing you to expose a local server to the internet. 
    
    **It's especially handy for development and testing purposes.**

1. Go to [Ngrok's official website](https://ngrok.com/).
2. Click on the =="Sign up"== button to begin the signup process.
3. Fill in the required details to create your account. 
4. Once registered, you will be redirected to the dashboard. 
5. Here, you'll find your `authtoken`, which is essential for configuring Ngrok tunnels. Keep this token at hand.

## Acquiring Ngrok Domains

1. Navigate to the =="Cloud Edge"== --> =="Domains"== section in your Ngrok dashboard.
2. Click on =="New domain"==.
3. You will be assigned newly created domain of something like `albacore-awake-commonly.ngrok-free.app`. This would be your **FRONTEND** domain.

!!! warning
    - The free tier of Ngrok allows for random domains on every tunnel creation or one static domain. 

!!! success
    You are good to go! Return back [to the next section](https://docs.medsync.botfather.dev/configuration/#3-bot-database-configuration) to continue the setup process.
